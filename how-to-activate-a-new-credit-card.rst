Before You Activate Your Capital One Card
------------------------------------------

While waiting for your new credit card to arrive, here are a few proactive steps you can take:

- **Review your account activity** if your previous card was lost or stolen. Look for any unfamiliar charges.  
- **Download the Capital One Mobile app** to be ready for quick activation and account management.  
- **Explore tools like Eno**, Capital One’s digital assistant, and **CreditWise**, a free credit monitoring service.

How Long Until You Can Use Your Card After Activation?
-------------------------------------------------------

Once you activate your Capital One card through `capitalone.com/activate <https://www.capitalone.com/activate>`_ or another method, you can use it immediately. In some cases, Capital One may provide access to a **virtual card number**, allowing you to start shopping online before the physical card arrives.

What If You Don’t Activate Your Capital One Card?
--------------------------------------------------

Even if you don’t activate the physical card, the account linked to it is still considered open. If left inactive too long, your issuer might close it, which could negatively impact your credit score.

Also, if you use your virtual card number or make purchases tied to the account, you’ll be responsible for the balance—whether you activated the physical card or not.
